The Stolen Bike Index ðŸš²
=======================
The Stolen Bike Index allows users to search for reported bike thefts by location and incident details.

This project was bootstrapped with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### Features

- [x] List of reported bike thefts worldwide.
- [x] Ability to - paginate (10 cases per page).
- [ ] Total number of bike theft cases per search.
- [ ] For each reported bike theft I want to see:
  - [ ] Case title
  - [ ] Case description
  - [ ] Date of the theft
  - [ ] Location of the theft
  - [ ] Picture of the bike, if available
- [ ] Filter reported bike thefts by partial case title.
- [ ] Loading state until the list is available.
- [ ] Error state if the list is unavailable.
- [ ] Empty state if there are no results.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
